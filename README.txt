-first to train the model and save it you run train&limeandshao.py (it shows the results using limeandshape)
-savemodel.py shows comparison between the accuracies of the models we used and the ensemble learning
-explain_with_lime_shap.py also shows the results using lime and shap according to a certain sample 
-predict.py we predict a certain example just for testing the model if the prediction is correct or not
we have pictures showing the results of shap and lime and also model accuracies ,also the model we trained is saved to use for prediction 
shap_force_plot.html shows on 1 sample how much each feature affects the prediction.
